## Contributing

Features are stored in their own Helm chart. That chart is not a standalone chart, but is included in the main
k8s-monitoring Helm chart as a dependency. The parent chart interacts with the feature chart via template functions.

To add a new feature, create a new Helm chart in the `charts` directory. The chart should have a `feature-` prefix in
its name. The following files are required for a feature chart:

-   `templates/_module.alloy.tpl` - This file should contain a template function named
    `feature.<feature-slug>.module` which should create an [Alloy module](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/get-started/modules/)
    that wraps the configuration for your feature. It should expose any of these arguments as appropriate:
    -   `metrics_destination` - An argument that defines where scrape metrics should be delivered.
    -   `logs_destination` - An argument that defines where logs should be delivered.
    -   `traces_destination` - An argument that defines where traces should be delivered.
    -   `profiles_destination` - An argument that defines where profiles should be delivered.

-   `templates/_notes.alloy.tpl` - This file should contain these template functions:
    -   `feature.<feature-slug>.notes.deployments` - This function returns a list of workloads that will be
    deployed to the Kubernetes Cluster by the feature.
    -   `feature.<feature-slug>.notes.task` - This function returns a 1-line summary of what this feature will do.
    -   `feature.<feature-slug>.notes.actions` - This function returns any prompts for the user to take additional
        action after deployment.
    -   `feature.<feature-slug>.summary` - This function a dictionary of settings, used for self-reporting metrics.
