# Global Private Image Registries

This example shows how to override the container image registries for every subchart. This can be used to support
air-gapped environments, or in environments where you might not want to use public image registries.

This example shows using the `global` object to set registry and pull secrets for most subcharts. However, subcharts
use different methods, even within the global objects, so it needs to be defined in both ways.

*   `global.image.registry` & `global.image.pullSecrets` - This applies to Alloy, Alloy Operator and Beyla.
*   `global.imageRegistry` & `global.imagePullSecrets` - This applies to kube-state-metrics, Node Exporter and Windows Exporter
*   Exceptions:
    *   Kepler does not utilize global settings. You must use:
        *   `clusterMetrics.kepler.image.repository` - The *full* image repository path.
        *   `clusterMetrics.kepler.imagePullSecrets`
    *   OpenCost also does not utilize global settings. You must use:
        *   `clusterMetrics.opencost.imagePullSecrets`
        *   `clusterMetrics.opencost.exporter.image.registry`

If you do not want to use the `global` object, registry and pull secrets can be set on each subchart
[individually](../individual).
