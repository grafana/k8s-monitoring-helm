# Private Image Registries

This example shows how to override the individual container image registries for every subchart. This can be used to
support air-gapped environments, or in environments where you might not want to use public image registries.

If you want to change the image registry for every subchart, you can use the `global` object to set the registry
[globally](../globally).
