# Remote Config

This example demonstrates how to configure Alloy to utilize
[remote configuration](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/config-blocks/remotecfg/). These two environment
variables must be set:

*   `GCLOUD_FM_COLLECTOR_ID` - The collector id. It should uniquely identify this Alloy instance. The value in practice is:
    *   For Deployments: `<cluster name>-<namespace>-<pod name>`
    *   For StatefulSets: `<cluster name>-<namespace>-<pod name>`
    *   For DaemonSets: `<cluster name>-<namespace>-<node name>`
*   `GCLOUD_RW_API_KEY` - The Grafana Cloud Access Policy token that has the following scopes:
    *   `fleet-management:read`
    *   `logs:write`
    *   `metrics:write`
    *   `traces:write`
    *   `profiles:write`

The values file below shows enabling the `alloy-metrics` StatefulSet and the `alloy-logs` DaemonSets and a convenient
way to set the environment variables automatically.
