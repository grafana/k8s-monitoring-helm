# Resource requests and limits

This example demonstrates how to set resource requests and limits for every Kubernetes deployment available from this
Helm chart. Resource requests ensure that the container has the necessary resources to run, while limits prevent it from
consuming too many resources. These settings are often not set by default, because the "correct" values depend on the
size and complexity of the cluster, the number of workloads and their activity, and many more factors.

For Alloy, there are [best practices](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/introduction/estimate-resource-usage/) for
setting these values, based on the purpose of that Alloy instance and the amount of data it is expected to handle.
