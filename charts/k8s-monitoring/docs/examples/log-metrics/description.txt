# Log Metrics

This example shows how to generate metrics based on the log data. It utilizes a `stage.metric` processor within the
[loki.process](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/loki/loki.process/#stagemetrics) component
to generate metrics captured from the Pod logs. This is a simple metric, but other metrics can be added, or more complex
stages can be utilized to filter and match on certain log lines and build metrics from them.
