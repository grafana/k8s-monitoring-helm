# Log Metrics

This example shows how to generate metrics based on the log data. It utilizes a `stage.metric` processor within the
[loki.process](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/loki/loki.process/#stagemetrics) component
to generate metrics captured from the Pod logs. This is an example metric, but other metrics can be added, or more
complex stages can be utilized to filter and match on certain log lines and build metrics from them.
