# Collector Storage Example

This example shows how to use volumes to enhance the abilities of metric scraping and log gathering. Metric scraping can
utilize a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) to store metrics in case Alloy was unable to deliver metrics. Log gathering can utilize
a volume to store log file positions, so Alloy remembers where to start reading logs from after a restart.
