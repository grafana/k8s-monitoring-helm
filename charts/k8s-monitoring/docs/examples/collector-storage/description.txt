# Collector Storage Example

This example shows how to use volumes to enhance the abilities of metric scraping and log gathering. Metric scraping can
utilize a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) to store metrics in case of a scrape failure. Log gathering can utilize a volume to
store log file positions, so it knows where to start reading logs from after a restart.
