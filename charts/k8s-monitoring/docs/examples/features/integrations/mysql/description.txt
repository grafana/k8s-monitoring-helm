# MySQL Integration

This example shows how to load two MySQL integration instances, which utilize Alloy's [prometheus.exporter.mysql](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/prometheus/prometheus.exporter.mysql/) component
to scrape metrics from the MySQL database. It also modifies the Pod Logs feature to add special log handling for MySQL
pods. The username and password for the `prod-db` example are stored in a Kubernetes secret.
