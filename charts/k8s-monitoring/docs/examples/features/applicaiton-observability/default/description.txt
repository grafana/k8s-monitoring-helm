# Application Observability

This example shows how to enable the Application Observability feature, which enables the collection of application
telemetry data. Enabling this feature requires enabling one or more receivers where data will be sent from the
application.

For more information, see the [Application Observability feature documentation](https://github.com/grafana/k8s-monitoring-helm/tree/main/charts/feature-application-observability).
