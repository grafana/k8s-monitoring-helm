# Auto-Instrumentation with Discovery Rules

This example demonstrates how to enable the auto-instrumentation feature, which deploys Grafana Beyla to automatically
instrument your application for metrics collection. It also shows how to set
[discovery rules](https://grafana.com/docs/beyla/latest/configure/service-discovery/) to control which services are
instrumented.

In this example, Beyla is configured with two discovery rules:

*   Do not instrument anything in the `kube-system` namespace.
*   Instrument anything with the Pod label `instrument=beyla`

## Values
