# Example: Auto-Instrumentation with Span Metrics Only

This example demonstrates how to use Beyla for automatic instrumentation while collecting only span metrics (RED metrics) without exporting full distributed traces.

## Use Case

This configuration is useful when you want:

*   **Metrics from auto-instrumented applications** (request rate, error rate, duration)
*   **Service graph metrics** showing relationships between services
*   **Lower data volume** by avoiding full trace exports
*   **Cost optimization** when trace storage is expensive

## How It Works

When `spanMetricsOnly: true` is set:

1.  Beyla automatically instruments applications using eBPF
2.  Beyla generates span metrics (RED metrics) from HTTP/gRPC calls
3.  Metrics are scraped by Alloy and sent to Prometheus
4.  **Full trace spans are NOT sent** to the OTLP receiver, even though Application Observability is enabled

## When to Use This

Choose `spanMetricsOnly: true` when:

*   You want observability without trace storage costs
*   You need RED metrics but not detailed trace analysis
*   You're instrumenting high-throughput services where full tracing would be too expensive
*   You already have tracing from other sources and only need Beyla for metrics

## Alternative

If you need full traces from Beyla, set `spanMetricsOnly: false` (the default) or omit the field entirely. See the [beyla-metrics-and-traces example](../beyla-metrics-and-traces/) for that configuration.
