# Proxies

This example shows how to use proxy URLs and TLS settings to modify how to send data to the external services.

## Directly setting proxies

Most destinations allow for proxy settings to be set directly on the destination configuration.

```yaml
- name: prometheus
  type: prometheus
  url: http://prometheus.example.com/api/v1/write
  proxyURL: https://myproxy.default.svc:8080
  noProxy: settings.example.com
  proxyConnectHeader:
    "MYPROXY-HEADER": ["my-proxy-header-value"]
```

The `prometheus`, `loki`, and `pyroscope` destinations support setting the `proxyURL`, `noProxy`, and
`proxyConnectHeader` options.

When using the `otlp` destination, the `proxyURL` setting is available if using the `http` protocol. However, if using
the `grpc` protocol, the `proxyURL` setting is not available. Instead, you can
use [environment variables](#using-environment-variables).

## Using environment variables

Another option which will work for all destination types is to use the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and/or `NO_PROXY`
environment variables. For `prometheus`, `loki`, and `pyroscope` destinations, use the `proxy_from_environment` option
to indicate that the proxy settings should be read from the environment variables. When using this method, watch out
for issues connecting to the Kubernetes API service, or other internal services.
