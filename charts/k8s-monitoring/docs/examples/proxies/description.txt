# Proxies

This example shows how to use proxy URLs and TLS settings to modify how to send data to the external services.

For Alloy, the [prometheus.remote_write](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/prometheus/prometheus.remote_write/),
[loki.write](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/loki/loki.write/), and
[pyroscope.write](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/pyroscope/pyroscope.write/) components all
support direct setting of a `proxyURL`. The [otelcol.exporter.otlp[http]](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/otelcol/otelcol.exporter.otlp/)
component does not, but uses the `HTTP_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` environment variables to set a proxy.
