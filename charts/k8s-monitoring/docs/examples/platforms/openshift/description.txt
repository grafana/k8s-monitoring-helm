# OpenShift

This example shows the modifications requires to deploy to an OpenShift cluster.

These modifications skip the deployment of kube-state-metrics and Node Exporter, since they will already be present on
the cluster, and adjust the configuration to Grafana Alloy to find those existing components.
It also modifies Grafana Alloy to lock down security and permissions.

The `platform: openshift` switch also creates SecurityContextConstraints objects that modifies the permissions for the
Grafana Alloy.

Note that these alloy pods cannot enable `readOnlyRootFilesystem` because they require being able to write to their
storage path, which defaults to `/tmp/alloy`.
