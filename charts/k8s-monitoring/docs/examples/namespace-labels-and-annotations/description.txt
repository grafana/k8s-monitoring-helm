# Namespaces Labels & Annotations

This example shows how to promote labels and annotations set on the Kubernetes Namespaces to the telemetry data for
metrics from that Namespace.

## Metrics

Labels and annotations on Kubernetes objects are not set as metric labels on metrics
like [kube_namespace_annotations](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/blob/main/docs/metrics/cluster/namespace-metrics.md).
This is because it would greatly increase metric cardinality, which can get costly.

This option is not enabled by default, so this example shows how to enable it. In the values file below, this section
tells the kube-state-metrics deployment to generate the `kube_pod_labels` metric for all labels on the Pod:

This example shows how to extract labels and annotations from the namespace of your application and make them available
as resource attributes in your telemetry signals. These attributes can then be promoted to datapoint attributes (labels)
for metrics, log attributes for logs, and resource attributes traces.

In this example:

-   The k8sattributes processor is configured to extract the `example.com/product` annotation and the `example.com/team`
    label from the namespace
-   The transform processor copies those values to datapoint attributes and make them available for application metrics.

As long as these are not promoted these will be available for `target_info` metric.

          key: "example.com/product"
          tag_name: "product"
      labels:
        - from: namespace
          key: "example.com/team"
          tag_name: "team"
  metrics:
    transforms:
      datapoint:
        - set(attributes["product"], resource.attributes["product"])
        - set(attributes["team"], resource.attributes["team"])
```
