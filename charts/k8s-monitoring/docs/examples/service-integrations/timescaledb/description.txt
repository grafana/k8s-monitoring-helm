# TimeScale DB

To gather metrics from Timescale databases, Alloy uses the `discovery.http` component to ask TimescaleDB for the correct
URL for scraping metrics. It will then scrape the metrics from the URL provided by TimescaleDB.

Certain settings must be configured in TimescaleDB Atlas to allow scraping. Refer to the
[Integrate with Prometheus](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/prometheus-integration/) documentation for full
details.

In this example, we utilize the `extraConfig` section to define the `discovery.http` component to request the scrape
target, and the `prometheus.scrape` component to scrape the database metrics. It uses a Kubernetes secret to store the
username, password, and group ID for the TimescaleDB database.
