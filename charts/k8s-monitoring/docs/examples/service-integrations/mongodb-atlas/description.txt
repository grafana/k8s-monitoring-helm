# MongoDB Atlas databases

To gather metrics from MongoDB Atlas databases, Alloy uses the `discovery.http` component to ask MongoDB for the correct
URL for scraping metrics. It will then scrape the metrics from the URL provided by MongoDB.

There are settings that must be set on the MongoDB side to permit this scraping. Refer to the
[Integrate with Prometheus](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/prometheus-integration/) documentation for full
details.

In this example, we utilize the `extraConfig` section to define the `discovery.http` component to request the scrape
target, and the `prometheus.scrape` component to scrape the database metrics. It uses a Kubernetes secret to store the
username, password, and group ID for the MongoDB Atlas database.
