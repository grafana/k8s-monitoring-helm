# MongoDB Atlas databases

To gather metrics from MongoDB Atlas databases, Alloy uses the `discovery.http` component to ask MongoDB for the correct
URL for scraping metrics. It will then scrape the metrics from the URL provided by MongoDB.

Certain settings must be configured in MongoDB Atlas to allow scraping. Refer to the
[Integrate with Prometheus](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/prometheus-integration/) documentation for full
details.

In this example, we utilize the `extraConfig` section of the Alloy Metrics collector to define a `discovery.http`
component which requests the scrape target, a `prometheus.scrape` component which scrapes the database metrics, and a
`prometheus.relabel` component which is used to filter the amount of metrics, but can be used for any metric
processing. It uses a Kubernetes secret to store the username, password, and group ID for the MongoDB Atlas database.
