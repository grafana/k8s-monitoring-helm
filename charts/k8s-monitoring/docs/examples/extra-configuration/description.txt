# Extra Configuration

This example shows how to include additional configuration components to the Alloy instances. These components are added
to any existing configuration and does not replace it or modify it in any way.

In the example below, note that the `discovery.kubernetes.animal_service` component discovers the Kubernetes Service by
namespace and label selectors. Metrics found are then forwarded to `prometheus.remote_write.<destination-name>.receiver`
for delivery.
