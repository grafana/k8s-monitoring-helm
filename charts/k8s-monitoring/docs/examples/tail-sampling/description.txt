# Tail Sampling

This example shows how to configure tail sampling for traces using the k8s-monitoring Helm chart. Tail sampling is a technique that allows you to make sampling decisions after all spans in a trace
have been collected, rather than making the decision at the beginning of the trace.

## What is Tail Sampling?

Unlike head sampling (where the sampling decision is made when the trace starts), tail sampling collects all spans for a trace and then makes a sampling decision based on the complete trace information. This allows for more sophisticated sampling strategies that can:

-   Keep all traces with errors regardless of their duration
-   Sample traces based on their total latency
-   Make decisions based on specific attributes present anywhere in the trace
-   Apply complex logic combining multiple conditions

## Configuration

This example configures tail sampling for traces sent to a Tempo/otlp destination. The configuration includes various sampling policies that demonstrate different tail sampling strategies.

In this example:

-   The tail sampling processor is configured with decision timing and caching parameters
-   Multiple sampling policies are defined including status code, latency, probabilistic, and attribute-based policies
-   The policies work together to ensure important traces are kept while reducing overall trace volume

The tail sampling configuration allows you to optimize trace storage costs while maintaining observability for critical traces.
