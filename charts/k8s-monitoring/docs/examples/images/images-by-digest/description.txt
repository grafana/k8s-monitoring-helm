# Images by Digest

This example shows how to reference the container images used by their digest. This is useful for ensuring that the
exact version of an image is used, as opposed to using a tag which may change over time. However, care should be taken
to ensure that the digest is correct and corresponds to the intended image version. This example uses a contrived
digest for demonstration purposes.
