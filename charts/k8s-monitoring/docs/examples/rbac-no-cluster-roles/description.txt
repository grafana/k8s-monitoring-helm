# RBAC: No Cluster Roles

This example shows how to deploy this chart without any ClusterRoles or ClusterRoleBindings.

Without these objects, there are some things that will not function:

## Node access

Anything that requires discovering Nodes is not allowed, which means metrics from these sources will not work:

* Kubelet
* Kubelet Resources
* Kubelet Probes
* cAdvisor

kube-state-metrics will only be able to generate metrics from the namespaces that are specified. This also means that it
is unable to generate metrics for cluster-scoped resources. `kube_node_info` for example is not possible without a
ClusterRole.

## Namespace scoped

Roles and RoleBindings are only created for the namespaces that are specified in the values file. This means that the
features in this chart can only gather telemetry data from those namespaces.
