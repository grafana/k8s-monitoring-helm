# Istio Service Mesh example

This example shows how to ensure that Alloy clustering when Istio Service Mesh is enabled and has deployed the Istio
sidecar to the Alloy pods. This change is necessary because the Alloy cluster's headless Service port name
[will not work](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/common-problems/network-issues/#503-error-while-accessing-headless-services)
if it keeps its default port name of `http`.
