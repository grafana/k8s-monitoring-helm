# Istio Service Mesh example

This example shows how to deploy within a cluster when Istio Service Mesh is enabled and has deployed the Istio
sidecar to the Alloy pods.

## Alloy Clustering

A change must be made to any Alloy instance that is using Alloy clustering because the Alloy cluster's headless Service
port name [will not work](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/common-problems/network-issues/#503-error-while-accessing-headless-services)
if it keeps its default port name of `http`.

## Alloy Receiver

Another change must be made for the Alloy receiver which accepts data from applications. The Application Observability
feature utilizes a [otelcol.processor.k8sattributes](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/otelcol/otelcol.processor.k8sattributes/)
component which enriches the telemetry data with Kubernetes metadata. This component uses the IP address of the
application pod to look up the metadata. Setting the Istio sidecar's [interception mode](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/istio.mesh.v1alpha1/#ProxyConfig-InboundInterceptionMode)
to `TPROXY` will preserve originating pod's IP and port, allowing the component to work as expected.
