# Extra Rules

This example shows several ways to provide additional labels and rules. Most metric sources include fields for:

*   `extraDiscoveryRules` - Rules that control service discovery, as well as setting labels from the discovered targets.
*   `extraMetricProcessingRules` - Rules that control metric processing, such as modifying labels or filtering metrics.
*   `metricsTuning` - More controls for keeping or dropping metrics. See [this example](../metrics-tuning) for more details.

Most logs sources include fields for:

*   `extraDiscoveryRules` - Rules that control service discovery, as well as setting labels from the discovered targets.
*   `extraLogProcessingStages` - Rules that control log processing, such as modifying labels or modifying content.
