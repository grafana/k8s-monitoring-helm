# Custom Destination: Kafka

This custom destination shows how to configure a destination that sends data to Apache Kafka. This example specifically
only chooses to send Kubernetes Cluster Events as logs, but the
[Kafka exporter](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/otelcol/otelcol.exporter.kafka) does support
sending metrics and traces as well.
