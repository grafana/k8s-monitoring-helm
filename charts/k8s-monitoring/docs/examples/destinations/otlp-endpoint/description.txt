# OTLP Endpoint Example

Some cloud services allow for sending all telemetry data to a single endpoint, which will then distribute the data to
the appropriate backend databases for storage. In this Helm chart, the
[OTLP Destination](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/send-data/otlp/send-data-otlp/) makes this possible. This
means that you can define a single destination for all of your telemetry data.
