# Loki Stdout Destination Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `loki-stdout` destination. The `loki-stdout` destination allows you to send
logs to stdout on the Alloy pod that captured them. This can be useful for debugging purposes when you might not want
to deliver certain logs to a Loki instance for persistent storage.
