# Metric Enrichment

This example shows how to use the `prometheus.enrich` component to attach labels to metrics from other sources.
In this example, we get the list of pods, extract the `color` label that's on the namespace, then combine that with any
metrics that have both `namespace` and `pod` already set. This is all done in a custom destination, which then forwards
to the standard prometheus destination

Sending `clusterMetrics` to the custom destination will ensure that the metrics go through the enrichment process first.
