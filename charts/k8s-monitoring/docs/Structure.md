# Structure

The Kubernetes Monitoring Helm chart contains many software packages, and builds a comprehensive set of configuration
and
secrets for those packages.
This document aims to describe and explain the structure of the Helm chart.

## Software Deployed

This Helm chart deploys several packages to generate and capture the telemetry data on the cluster. This list
corresponds to the list of dependencies in this chart's Chart.yaml file. For each package, there is an associated
section inside the Helm chart's values.yaml file that controls how it is configured.

### Grafana Alloy instances

You may wonder why there are three instances of Grafana Alloy, rather than combining them. The reason is a balance
between functionality and scalability. The default functionality of the Grafana Alloy for Logs is to gather logs via
HostPath volume mounts. This requires it to be deployed as a DaemonSet. The Grafana Alloy for metrics and receivers is
deployed as a StatefulSet, which allows it to be scaled (optionally with a HorizontalPodAutoscaler) based on load. If it
was combined with the Alloy for Logs, it would lose its ability to scale.

Also, the Grafana Alloy for Events cannot be scaled beyond one replica, because that would result in duplicate events
being sent to the logs service.

## Configuration Created

This Helm chart also creates the configuration files, stored in ConfigMaps, for the Grafana Alloy instances. The
following lists describe the pieces of the configuration files and the section in the chart's values.yaml file that
controls it.
