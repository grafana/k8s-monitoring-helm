* `ci-values.yaml`
  * Default tests
  * Control plane metrics
  * Extra test queries
* `ci-2-values.yaml`
  * Sending metrics, logs, and traces via OTLP HTTP
  * Pod logs gathered via K8s API and PodLogs objects
  * Filtering pod logs by namespace
  * Custom test queries, including LogQL and TraceQL queries

  * Loading integrations via Service annotations

## Architecture

The CI/CD test environment is deployed out like this:

![Deployment architecture](architecture.png "Deployment architecture")

* Telemetry Sources
  * Cert Manager, used for testing discovery using service annotations
  * Grafana Alloy, used for pushing metrics and traces using receivers
  * MySQL, used for testing module integrations
  * Prometheus, used for testing discovery using pod annotations and https
  * Loki, used for testing discovery using ServiceMonitor objects
  * Grafana, used for gathering logs via a PodLogs object
  * The rest of Kubernetes
* Subject under test
  * k8s-monitoring helm chart, which deploys its own set of Grafana Alloy instances
* Data storage
  * Prometheus
  * Loki
    * Another Grafana Alloy instance, which accepts logs via OTLP, translates to Loki and writes to this Loki service
  * Tempo
* Data visualization
  * Grafana
