# Feature: Annotation Autodiscovery

{{ template "chart.deprecationWarning" . }}

The annotation-based autodiscovery feature adds scrape targets based on Kubernetes annotations.

## Usage

```yaml
annotationAutodiscovery:
  enabled: true
```

## How it works

With this feature enabled, any Kubernetes Pods or Services with the `k8s.grafana.com/scrape` annotation set to `true` will be automatically discovered
and scraped by the collector. 

You can use several other annotations to customize the behavior of the scrape configuration, such as:

*   `k8s.grafana.com/job`: The value to use for the `job` label.
*   `k8s.grafana.com/instance`: The value to use for the `instance` label.
*   `k8s.grafana.com/metrics.container`: The name of the container within the Pod to scrape for metrics. This is used to target a specific container within a Pod that has multiple containers.
*   `k8s.grafana.com/metrics.path`: The path to scrape for metrics. Defaults to `/metrics`.
*   `k8s.grafana.com/metrics.portNumber`: The port on the Pod or Service to scrape for metrics. This is used to target a specific port by its number, rather than all ports.
*   `k8s.grafana.com/metrics.portName`: The named port on the Pod or Service to scrape for metrics. This is used to target a specific port by its name, rather than all ports.
*   `k8s.grafana.com/metrics.scheme`: The scheme to use when scraping metrics. Defaults to `http`.
*   `k8s.grafana.com/metrics.param`: Allows for setting HTTP parameters when calling the scrape endpoint. Use with `k8s.grafana.com/metrics.param_<key>="<value>"`.
*   `k8s.grafana.com/metrics.scrapeInterval`: The scrape interval to use when scraping metrics. Defaults to `60s`.
*   `k8s.grafana.com/metrics.scrapeTimeout`: The scrape timeout to use when scraping metrics. Defaults to `10s`.

## Testing

This chart contains unit tests to verify the generated configuration. The hidden value `deployAsConfigMap` will render
the generated configuration into a ConfigMap object. While this ConfigMap is not used during regular operation, you can
use it to show the outcome of a given values file.

The unit tests use this ConfigMap to create an object with the configuration that can be asserted against. To run the
tests, use `helm test`.

Be sure perform actual integration testing in a live environment in the main [k8s-monitoring](../..) chart.
