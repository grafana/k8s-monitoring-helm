      Grafana k8s-monitoring Helm chart deployed!

      This chart will install the following components:
      * Grafana Alloy Operator
      * Grafana Alloy "alloy-singleton" (deployment, 1 replica)

      It will:
      * Gather Kubernetes Cluster events and send data to otlp*.

      * One or more features will have their data translated to a different storage ecosystem. This may result in an imperfect
        translation of labels and attributes. For more information, consult:
