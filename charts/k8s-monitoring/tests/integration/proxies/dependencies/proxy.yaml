    ## tinyproxy.conf -- tinyproxy daemon configuration file
    ##
    ## This example tinyproxy.conf file contains example settings
    ## with explanations in comments. For decriptions of all
    ## parameters, see the tinproxy.conf(5) manual page.
    ##

    #
    # User/Group: This allows you to set the user and group that will be
    # used for tinyproxy after the initial binding to the port has been done
    # as the root user. Either the user or group name or the UID or GID
    # number may be used.
    #
    User nobody
    Group nogroup

    #
    # Port: Specify the port which tinyproxy will listen on.  Please note
    # that should you choose to run on a port lower than 1024 you will need
    # to start tinyproxy using root.
    #
    Port 8888

    #
    # Listen: If you have multiple interfaces this allows you to bind to
    # only one. If this is commented out, tinyproxy will bind to all
    # interfaces present.
    #
    #Listen 192.168.0.1

    #
    # Bind: This allows you to specify which interface will be used for
    # outgoing connections.  This is useful for multi-home'd machines where
    # you want all traffic to appear outgoing from one particular interface.
    #
    #Bind 192.168.0.1

    #
    # BindSame: If enabled, tinyproxy will bind the outgoing connection to the
    # ip address of the incoming connection.
    #
    #BindSame yes

    #
    # Timeout: The maximum number of seconds of inactivity a connection is
    # allowed to have before it is closed by tinyproxy.
    #
    Timeout 600

    #
    # ErrorFile: Defines the HTML file to send when a given HTTP error
    # occurs.  You will probably need to customize the location to your
    # particular install.  The usual locations to check are:
    #   /usr/local/share/tinyproxy
    #   /usr/share/tinyproxy
    #   /etc/tinyproxy
    #
    #ErrorFile 404 "@pkgdatadir@/404.html"
    #ErrorFile 400 "@pkgdatadir@/400.html"
    #ErrorFile 503 "@pkgdatadir@/503.html"
    #ErrorFile 403 "@pkgdatadir@/403.html"
    #ErrorFile 408 "@pkgdatadir@/408.html"

    #
    # DefaultErrorFile: The HTML file that gets sent if there is no
    # HTML file defined with an ErrorFile keyword for the HTTP error
    # that has occurred.
    #
    DefaultErrorFile "@pkgdatadir@/default.html"

    #
    # StatHost: This configures the host name or IP address that is treated
    # as the stat host: Whenever a request for this host is received,
    # Tinyproxy will return an internal statistics page instead of
    # forwarding the request to that host.  The default value of StatHost is
    # @TINYPROXY_STATHOST@.
    #
    #StatHost "@TINYPROXY_STATHOST@"
    #

    #
    # StatFile: The HTML file that gets sent when a request is made
    # for the stathost.  If this file doesn't exist a basic page is
    # hardcoded in tinyproxy.
    #
    StatFile "@pkgdatadir@/stats.html"

    #
    # LogLevel: Warning
    #
    # Set the logging level. Allowed settings are:
    #	Critical	(least verbose)
    #	Error
    #	Warning
    #	Notice
    #	Connect		(to log connections without Info's noise)
    #	Info		(most verbose)
    #
    # The LogLevel logs from the set level and above. For example, if the
    # LogLevel was set to Warning, then all log messages from Warning to
    # Critical would be output, but Notice and below would be suppressed.
    #
    LogLevel Info

    #
    # MaxClients: This is the absolute highest number of threads which will
    # be created. In other words, only MaxClients number of clients can be
    # connected at the same time.
    #
    MaxClients 1024

    #
    # Allow: Customization of authorization controls. If there are any
    # access control keywords then the default action is to DENY. Otherwise,
    # the default action is ALLOW.
    #
    # The order of the controls are important. All incoming connections are
    # tested against the controls based on order.
    #
    #Allow 127.0.0.1
    #Allow ::1

    #
    # AddHeader: Adds the specified headers to outgoing HTTP requests that
    # Tinyproxy makes. Note that this option will not work for HTTPS
    # traffic, as Tinyproxy has no control over what headers are exchanged.
    #
    #AddHeader "X-My-Header" "Powered by Tinyproxy"

    #
    # ViaProxyName: The "Via" header is required by the HTTP RFC, but using
    # the real host name is a security concern.  If the following directive
    # is enabled, the string supplied will be used as the host name in the
    # Via header; otherwise, the server's host name will be used.
    #
    ViaProxyName "tinyproxy"

    #
    # DisableViaHeader: When this is set to yes, Tinyproxy does NOT add
    # the Via header to the requests. This virtually puts Tinyproxy into
    # stealth mode. Note that RFC 2616 requires proxies to set the Via
    # header, so by enabling this option, you break compliance.
    # Don't disable the Via header unless you know what you are doing...
    #
    DisableViaHeader Yes

    #
    # Filter: This allows you to specify the location of the filter file.
    #
    Filter "/etc/tinyproxy/filter"

    #
    # FilterDefaultDeny: Change the default policy of the filtering system.
    # If this directive is commented out, or is set to "No" then the default
    # policy is to allow everything which is not specifically denied by the
    # filter file.
    #
    # However, by setting this directive to "Yes" the default policy becomes
    # to deny everything which is _not_ specifically allowed by the filter
    # file.
    #
    FilterDefaultDeny Yes
