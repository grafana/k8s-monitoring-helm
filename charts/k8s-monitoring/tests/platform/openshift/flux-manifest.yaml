                  This can improve performance, but may cause issues with some Helm charts
                  that for example do create Custom Resource Definitions during installation
                  outside Helm's CRD lifecycle hooks, which are then not observed to be
                  available by e.g. post-install hooks.

                      CRDs are installed but not updated.

                      Skip: do neither install nor replace (update) any CRDs.

                      Create: new CRDs are created, existing CRDs are neither updated nor deleted.

                      CreateReplace: new CRDs are created, existing CRDs are updated (replaced)
                      but not deleted.

                      By default, CRDs are applied (installed) during Helm install action.
                      With this option users can opt-in to CRD replace existing CRDs on Helm
                      install actions, which is not (yet) natively supported by Helm.

                          tests are run after an install action but fail. Defaults to

                      Replace tells the Helm install action to re-use the 'ReleaseName', but only

                    description: |-
                      SkipCRDs tells the Helm install action to not install any CRDs. By default,
                      CRDs are installed if not already present.

                      Deprecated use CRD policy (`crds`) attribute with value `Skip` instead.

                  When used in combination with HelmReleaseSpec.ServiceAccountName,
                  forces the controller to act on behalf of that Service Account at the
                  target cluster.
                  If the --default-service-account flag is set, its value will be used as
                  a controller level fallback for when HelmReleaseSpec.ServiceAccountName

                      SecretRef holds the name of a secret that contains a key with
                      the kubeconfig file as the value. If no key is set, the key will default
                      to 'value'.
                      It is recommended that the kubeconfig is self-contained, and the secret
                      is regularly updated if credentials such as a cloud-access-token expire.
                      Cloud specific `cmd-path` auth helpers will not function without adding
                      binaries and credentials to the Pod that is responsible for reconciling
                      Kubernetes resources.

                  MaxHistory is the number of revisions saved by Helm for this HelmRelease.
                  Use '0' for an unlimited number of revisions; defaults to '10'.
                type: integer
              persistentClient:
                description: |-
                  PersistentClient tells the controller to use a persistent Kubernetes
                  client for this release. When enabled, the client will be reused for the
                  duration of the reconciliation, instead of being created and destroyed
                  for each (step of a) Helm action.

                  This can improve performance, but may cause issues with some Helm charts
                  that for example do create Custom Resource Definitions during installation
                  outside Helm's CRD lifecycle hooks, which are then not observed to be
                  available by e.g. post-install hooks.

                  If not set, it defaults to true.

                      CRDs are neither installed nor upgraded.

                      Skip: do neither install nor replace (update) any CRDs.

                      Create: new CRDs are created, existing CRDs are neither updated nor deleted.

                      CreateReplace: new CRDs are created, existing CRDs are updated (replaced)
                      but not deleted.

                      By default, CRDs are not applied during Helm upgrade action. With this
                      option users can opt-in to CRD upgrade, which is not (yet) natively supported by Helm.

                  PersistentClient tells the controller to use a persistent Kubernetes
                  client for this release. When enabled, the client will be reused for the
                  duration of the reconciliation, instead of being created and destroyed
                  for each (step of a) Helm action.

                  This can improve performance, but may cause issues with some Helm charts
                  that for example do create Custom Resource Definitions during installation
                  outside Helm's CRD lifecycle hooks, which are then not observed to be
                  available by e.g. post-install hooks.
