* {{ $task }} and send data to {{ include "english_list" $destinations }}.
  {{- end }}
{{- end }}

{{- range $feature := (include "features.list.enabled" .) | fromYamlArray }}
  {{- $collectorName := (index $.Values $feature).collector }}
  {{- $Collector := dict "Namespace" $.Release.Namespace }}
  {{- if $collectorName }}
    {{- $Collector = merge $Collector (dict "ServiceName" (include "alloy.fullname" (index $.Subcharts $collectorName))) }}
