![Version: 1.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0.0-informational?style=flat-square) ![AppVersion: 1.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/AppVersion-1.0.0-informational?style=flat-square)

Gathers Kubernetes Cluster metrics

This chart deploys the Cluster Metrics feature of the Kubernetes Observability Helm chart. It includes the ability to
collect metrics from the Kubernetes Cluster itself, from sources like the Kubelet and cAdvisor, from common supporting
services like [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics) and
[Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter), and from systems to capture additional data like Kepler.

## Metric systems

The Cluster Metrics feature of the Kubernetes Observability Helm chart includes the following metric systems:

*   Kubelet
*   cAdvisor
*   API Server
*   Kube Controller Manager
*   Kube Proxy
*   Kube Scheduler
*   kube-state-metrics
*   Node Exporter
*   Windows Exporter
*   Kepler

### Kubelet

Kubelet metrics gather information about Kubernetes information on each node.

The kubelet metric source uses an [allow list](#metrics-tuning--allow-lists),
[default-allow-lists/kubelet.yaml](./default-allow-lists/kubelet.yaml).

### cAdvisor

[cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor) metrics gather information about containers on each node.

The cAdvisor metric source uses an [allow list](#metrics-tuning--allow-lists),
[default-allow-lists/cadvisor.yaml](./default-allow-lists/cadvisor.yaml).

### API Server

API Server metrics gather information about the Kubernetes API Server.

### Kube Controller Manager

Kube Controller Manager metrics gather information about the Kubernetes Controller Manager.

### Kube Proxy

Kube Proxy metrics gather information about the Kubernetes Proxy.

### Kube Scheduler

Kube Scheduler metrics gather information about the Kubernetes Scheduler.

### kube-state-metrics

[kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics) metrics gather information about Kubernetes
resources inside the cluster.

The kube-state-metrics metric source uses an [allow list](#metrics-tuning--allow-lists),
[default-allow-lists/kube-state-metrics.yaml](./default-allow-lists/kube-state-metrics.yaml).

### Node Exporter

[Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) metrics gather information about Linux Kubernetes Nodes.

The Node Exporter metric source uses an [allow list](#metrics-tuning--allow-lists),
[default-allow-lists/node-exporter.yaml](./default-allow-lists/node-exporter.yaml), and has an integration allow list,
[default-allow-lists/node-exporter-integration.yaml](./default-allow-lists/node-exporter-integration.yaml).

### Windows Exporter

[Windows Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/windows_exporter) metrics gather information about Windows
Kubernetes Nodes.

The Windows Exporter metric source uses an [allow list](#metrics-tuning--allow-lists),
[default-allow-lists/windows-exporter.yaml](./default-allow-lists/windows-exporter.yaml).

### Kepler

[Kepler](https://sustainable-computing.io/) metrics gather information about the Kubernetes cluster.

The Kepler metric source uses an [allow list](#metrics-tuning--allow-lists),
[default-allow-lists/kepler.yaml](./default-allow-lists/kepler.yaml).

## Metrics Tuning & Allow Lists

All metric sources have the ability to adjust the amount of metrics being scraped and their labels. This can be useful
to limit the number of metrics delivered to your destinations. Many of the metric sources also have an allow list, which
is a set of metric names that will be kept, while any metrics not on the list will be dropped. The allow lists are tuned
to return a useful, but minimal set of metrics for typical use cases. Some sources have an "integration allow list",
which contains even more metrics for diving into the details of the source itself.

To control these settings, use the `metricsTuning` section in the values file.

```yaml
<metric source>:
  metricsTuning:
    useDefaultAllowList: <boolean>      # Use the allow list for this metric source
    useIntegrationAllowList: <boolean>  # Use the integration allow list for this metric source
    includeMetrics: [<string>]          # Metrics to be kept
    excludeMetrics: [<string>]          # Metrics to be dropped
```

The behavior of the combination of these settings is shown in this table:

| Allow List | includeMetrics   | excludeMetrics           | Result                                                                                                                                  |
|------------|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| true       | `[]`             | `[]`                     | Use the allow list metric list                                                                                                          |
| false      | `[]`             | `[]`                     | No filter, keep all metrics                                                                                                             |
| true       | `[my_metric]`    | `[]`                     | Use the allow list metric list with an additional metric                                                                                |
| false      | `[my_metric_.*]` | `[]`                     | *Only* keep metrics that start with `my_metric_`                                                                                        |
| true       | `[]`             | `[my_metric_.*]`         | Use the allow list metric filter, but exclude anything that starts with `my_metric_`                                                    |
| false      | `[]`             | `[my_metric_.*]`         | Keep all metrics except anything that starts with `my_metric_`                                                                          |
| true       | `[my_metric_.*]` | `[other_metric_.*]`      | Use the allow list metric filter, and keep anything that starts with `my_metric_`, but remove anything that starts with `other_metric_` |
| false      | `[my_metric_.*]` | `[my_metric_not_needed]` | *Only* keep metrics that start with `my_metric_`, but remove any that are named `my_metric_not_needed`                                  |

In addition to all fo this, you can also use the `extraMetricProcessingRules` section to add arbitrary relabeling rules that can be used to take any
action on the metric list, including filtering based on label or other actions.
