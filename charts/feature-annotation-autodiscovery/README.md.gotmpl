The annotation-based autodiscovery feature makes it easy to add scrape targets. With this feature enabled, any
Kubernetes Pods or Services with the `k8s.grafana.com/scrape` annotation set to `true` will be automatically discovered
and scraped by the collector. There are several other annotations that can be used to customize the behavior of the
scrape configuration, such as:

*   `k8s.grafana.com/job`: The value to use for the `job` label.
*   `k8s.grafana.com/instance`: The value to use for the `instance` label.
*   `k8s.grafana.com/metrics.path`: The path to scrape for metrics. Defaults to `/metrics`.
*   `k8s.grafana.com/metrics.portNumber`: The port on the Pod or Service to scrape for metrics. This is used to target a specific port by its number, rather than all ports.
*   `k8s.grafana.com/metrics.portName`: The named port on the Pod or Service to scrape for metrics. This is used to target a specific port by its name, rather than all ports.
*   `k8s.grafana.com/metrics.scheme`: The scheme to use when scraping metrics. Defaults to `http`.
*   `k8s.grafana.com/metrics.scrapeInterval`: The scrape interval to use when scraping metrics. Defaults to `60s`.

## Testing

This chart contains unit tests to verify the generated configuration. A hidden value, `deployAsConfigMap`, will render
the generated configuration into a ConfigMap object. This ConfigMap is not used during regular operation, but it is
useful for showing the outcome of a given values file.

The unit tests use this to create an object with the configuration that can be asserted against. To run the tests, use
`helm test`.

Actual integration testing in a live environment should be done in the main [k8s-monitoring](../k8s-monitoring) chart.
