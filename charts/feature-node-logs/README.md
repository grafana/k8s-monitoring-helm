# k8s-monitoring-feature-node-logs

![Version: 1.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0.0-informational?style=flat-square) ![Type: application](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-application-informational?style=flat-square) ![AppVersion: 1.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/AppVersion-1.0.0-informational?style=flat-square)
Kubernetes Observability feature for gathering Cluster Node logs.

The Node Logs feature enables the collection of logs from Kubernetes Cluster Nodes.

## Testing

This chart contains unit tests to verify the generated configuration. A hidden value, `deployAsConfigMap`, will render
the generated configuration into a ConfigMap object. This ConfigMap is not used during regular operation, but it is
useful for showing the outcome of a given values file.

The unit tests use this to create an object with the configuration that can be asserted against. To run the tests, use
`helm test`.

Actual integration testing in a live environment should be done in the main [k8s-monitoring](../k8s-monitoring) chart.

## Values

### General settings

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| fullnameOverride | string | `""` | Full name override |
| nameOverride | string | `""` | Name override |

### Journal Logs

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| journal.extraDiscoveryRules | string | `""` | Rule blocks to be added used with the loki.source.journal component for journal logs. These relabeling rules are applied pre-scrape against the targets from service discovery. Before the scrape, any remaining target labels that start with `__` (i.e. `__meta_kubernetes*`) are dropped. ([docs](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/discovery/discovery.relabel/#rule-block)) **Note:** Many field names from journald start with an `_`, such as `_systemd_unit`. The final internal label name would be `__journal__systemd_unit`, with two underscores between `__journal` and `systemd_unit`. |
| journal.extraLogProcessingBlocks | string | `""` | Stage blocks to be added to the loki.process component for journal logs. ([docs](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/loki/loki.process/#blocks)) This value is templated so that you can refer to other values from this file. |
| journal.formatAsJson | bool | `false` | Whether to forward the original journal entry as JSON. |
| journal.jobLabel | string | `"integrations/kubernetes/journal"` | The value for the job label for journal logs. |
| journal.maxAge | string | `"8h"` | The path to the journal logs on the worker node. |
| journal.path | string | `"/var/log/journal"` | The path to the journal logs on the worker node. |
| journal.units | list | `[]` | The list of systemd units to keep scraped logs from. If empty, all units are scraped. |
